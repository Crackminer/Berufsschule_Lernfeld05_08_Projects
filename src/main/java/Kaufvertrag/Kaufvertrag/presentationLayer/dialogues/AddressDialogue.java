  /*
  Idea is this separate frame contains all the necessary steps to create a new address.

  IMPORTANT:
  - ensure no other dialogue is currently running
  - ensure you cant go back to main window when this dialogue is open (standard JDialog behaviour)

  step 1:
  - seperate frame from program, similar to a jdialog

  step 2:
  - prompt user to input all the relevant fields for a new Address

  step 3:
  - let user click confirm only after all relevant info is given and is valid (housenumber not beginning with letter for example).

  step 4:
  - let user verify his inputs are correct

  step 5:
  - close window, call update list in address list to add the new address to the list
